# Quantum Genetics Accelerator  
_Where genetic computation meets quantum-inspired logic, and FPGA becomes a lens to decode aging._

##  Introduction

**Quantum Genetics Accelerator** is an experimental framework that explores the intersection of simulated quantum computation, genetic data analysis, and machine learning. Built on a philosophy that innovation is memory rediscovered, it seeks to simulate quantum behavior using classical reconfigurable logic (FPGA) to analyze synthetic DNA sequences with aging-inspired mutations.

It is not just an academic project. It is an ontological prototype — designed to observe, classify, and reinterpret patterns in biological data through a quantum-like lens. Inspired by bioinformatics, neuroscience, and future aerospace applications.

##  Objectives

- Simulate quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, Toffoli) on DNA-like sequences using Verilog and FPGA.
- Generate synthetic genetic patterns to emulate biological aging and cellular mutation behavior.
- Analyze quantum-processed outputs using AI classifiers and clustering methods.
- Provide an open platform for studying DNA entropy, mutation signatures, and predictive genomics.
- Explore applications in medicine, neuroscience, and space genetics.

##  Core Components

- `dna_quant_processor.v`: Logic core for simulated quantum-like transformation of DNA sequences.
- `quant_interface.v`: Data bridge between FPGA and external analysis layers.
- `dna_sequence_generator.py`: Controlled generation of biological patterns with age/mutation variation.
- `quantum_dna_simulator.py`: Emulation of quantum behavior applied to DNA data.
- `dna_analysis_ai.py`: Machine learning pipeline for pattern recognition and classification.
- `celebro_cerberus_v2.sh`: Full bash-driven orchestration of all steps in the pipeline.
